Based on project ‚ù§Ô∏è <https://github.com/matt8707/ha-fusion>, but my approach does not align well with the project goals

## üì£ Alpha

The current state of this project is **pre-beta**. This means that there's basic functionality missing, incomplete features and unresolved issues. General feedback, bug reports and feature requests are welcome!

## Installation

### Docker

If you're using the "Container" or "Core" installation methods, ha-fusion-pro can be installed via Docker:

1. **Docker Compose File**: Place your edited copy of the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/bzzim/ha-fusion-pro/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file in a suitable directory.

2. **Create Container**:
   Run the following commands in your terminal to start the container:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/docker-compose.yml
   docker-compose up -d ha-fusion-pro
   ```

#### Update

To update to the latest version of ha-fusion-pro, run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose pull ha-fusion-pro
docker-compose up -d ha-fusion-pro
```

Without docker-compose, updating the container involves additional steps. For each update, it's necessary to first stop the current container, remove it, pull the new image, and then execute the docker run command again.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ha-fusion-pro \
  --network bridge \
  -p 5050:5050 \
  -v /path/to/ha-fusion-pro:/app/data \
  -e TZ=Asia/Yekaterinburg \
  -e HASS_URL=http://192.168.100.150:8123 \
  --restart always \
  ghcr.io/bzzim/ha-fusion-pro
```

</details>

## Query strings

These will only function if you have exposed a port in the add-on configuration or by using Docker. Note that when using Ingress, query strings cannot be read.

### View

To set a particular view when the page loads, add the "view" parameter. For example, if you have a "Bedroom" view, append the query string `?view=Bedroom` to the URL.

### Menu

To disable the menu button, append the query string `?menu=false` to the URL. This is useful when you want to avoid unwanted changes to your dashboard, such as on wall-mounted tablets.
